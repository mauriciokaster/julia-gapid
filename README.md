# julia-gapid
GAPID control implemented in Julia

This repository contains implementations of some models (Buck converter, DC Motor) and the GAPID controller.
This controller parameters are optimized by employing meta-heuristics (Genetic Algorithm, PSO).
The main purpose of using Julia programming is due to its high performance.
